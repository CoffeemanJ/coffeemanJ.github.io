        <h3>International Coffee Farm</h3>
        <p>ICFC (Panama) S.A, currently owns 8 coffee farms located in very suitable locations for growing specialty coffee, in terms of climate and soil conditions.  The farms are located in the North area of Boquete in Horqueta, to the West in Volcancito and Palmira Arriba, and in the East in Jaramillo Arriba. All farms were carefully chosen considering their potential to produce high-quality specialty coffee, located in a range of altitude between 1250 and 1750+ meters above sea level. Due to our strategic locations in three cardinal points of the compass, we have a wide range of microclimates that produce coffees to offer for all profiles.</p>
        <p>We have multiple varietals including Typica, Bourbon, Geisha, Pacamara, Caturra and Catuai. The latter being the main varietal currently produced in our farms. In 2016/2017 we began planting more Catuai, Pacamara, Typica and Geisha throughout our farms. All of these varietals grow under the canopy of a vast variety of trees and bushes in our shade-grown coffee farms.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to develop a truly sustainable system in social, environmental and economic terms, our mill was designed to reduce the water load necessary to process the coffee. Additionally, we are developing innovative activities that will help us to close the cycle and manage the potential byproducts and wastes produced in the system, to minimize the environmental pollution and any discomfort to the surrounding communities.

        <h3>ABU Coffee</h3>

        <img src="img/logo/Abu.png">
          </section>
        <p>ABU COFFEE is a Geisha varietal cultivated in the region of Cañas Verdes, Boquete in a humid and rainy microclimate typical of the tropical forest. Coffee trees are grown on the slopes of the Barú Volcano National park in fertile, profound soils of volcanic origin rich with organic content and excellent drainage, minimizing erosion.

Average altitude is 1550 meters above sea level. The shade protecting the plantation is given by native trees that grow in harmony with abundant local flora and fauna, respecting the environment and biodiversity. Given its strategic geographic location, sunlight is a key element throughout the whole process. The plantation receives powerful solar radiation, interrupted in the mornings and sunsets by a soft tropical mist known locally as Bajareque and caressed by thick fog.

        </section>

              <p>Located within some of the best coffee producing areas in the world, our farms produce prize-winning Typical, Caturra, Catuai and Geisha Coffees.

We have been honored on various occasions by winning awards in the annual Best Of Panama International Cupping Competition.

The farms are located in Boquete,  at altitudes ranging from 1350 meters to 2200 meters above sea-level. Each farm has its own micro-climate which permits the production of different, unique, quality coffees. These coffees are sought after all over the world.

We believe in not only producing excellent coffee’s  but also in improving the quality of life of the workers who are involved in this endeavor. To attain this goal, we have constructed family housing which involves one apartment per worker and his family. The apartments have a full kitchen, living and bedrooms and all personal hygiene is done in bathing areas separating men and women. This housing is governed by a Board of Directors elected from the workers and by the workers who control the operation and cleanliness of all common areas within the living compound. All utilities are covered by the company.

        <h3>Washed Process</h3>
        <img src="img/slider/bean.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The goal of the washed process is to remove all of the sticky flesh from the coffee seed before it is dried. This greatly reduces
        the chance of something going wrong during drying, so coffee is likely to be worth more. However this particular process is much more expensive
      than the others.
        After picking, the coffee cherry has its outer skin and most of the fruit flesh stripped off using a machine called a depulper. The Coffee is kitchen
        moved to a clean thank or trought of water where the remainder of the flesh is removed by fermentation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fruit flesh contains a lot of pectin and it is firmly attached to the seed but the fermentation breaks down the remaining flesh enough for it to be wahsed away.
        different producers use different amount of water during the fermentation stage, and there are some environmental concerns about this method, partly due to the eventual fate of
        waste water, which can be toxic.
       </p>
    </div>
      <div class="one-third-padding">
        <h3>Natural Process</h3>
        <img src="img/slider/bean.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Also known as the dry process, this is the oldest method of processing coffee. After harvest, the coffee cherries are spread out in a thin layer to dry in the sun.
        Some producers spread them out on brick patios, others use special raised drying tables, which allow a better airflow around the cherry, resulting in more even drying. The Cherries must be turned regularly to avoid mould,
        fermentation or rottinng taking place. Once the coffee  is properly dry, the outer husk of skin and dried fruit are removed mechanically, and the raw coffee is then stored before export.

  </p>
        <p>
          The Natural process itself adds certain flavours to the coffee, However, if there is no access to water this may be the only process open to the producer and is therefore common in places like Ethiopia, and Also
          parts of Brazil. This process ramians quite traditional in places and there is certainly demand for the cup qualities that a carefully processed lot can have.

        </p>

        <p>
          The process will often add fruit flavours to the coffee, regardless of variety and terroir. These are usually described as hints of blueberry, strawberry or tropical fruit.

        </p>

      <div class="one-third-padding">
        <h3>Special ASD Process</h3>
        <img src="img/slider/bean.jpg" alt="">
        <p>ASD stands for Anaerobic Slow Dry, wherein the coffee is placed into fermentation tanks for 120 hours with the pulp, and then placed onto drying beds with a thick layer for a total time of five weeks. This ASD processed Geisha coffee was used for brewers cup by Wilford Jr. of Lamastus Estates in 2019. The coffee beans were grown in 1850 Masl in the Torre lot, and this lot is a neighbor lot from the Best of Panama Elida Geisha Green-Tip ASD of 2019.</p>
        <p>
          "Anaerobic  is a term farmers used to describe a sealed environment." This style of fermentation may extend the traditional timeframe of 12-36 hours by hours or even days in some cases such as the technique Wilford Lamastus has used a 120 hour fermentation in sealed tanks.
